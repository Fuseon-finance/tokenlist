# Kodo Exchange Token Assets

This repository contains official assets for the Kodo Exchange.

`veKDO` holders decide which liquidity **pools** receive emissions by voting on their preferred liquidity pool **gauges**. While Kodo allows permissionless **pool** creation, only *whitelisted* tokens can be included in permissionless **gauge** creation for a pool. *Whitelisting* your token on Kodo offers:

- Your token's logo in the UI for easy trading.
- Gauge creation to unlock all Kodo's features, including voting, bribing, and emissions rewards.
- Eligibility for Kodo's liquidity incentive program.

## Token Listing on Kodo

To *whitelist* a token, submit a PR with the required information to this repository. As an alternative, [open a ticket on Kodo Discord](https://discord.com/invite/p99hk4actg) to get our support!

## Emergency Council

Requirements for *whitelisting* are critical to ensuring that our protocol cannot be exploited by actors attempting to game emissions.

To support the health of the protocol and ecosystem, the **Emergency Council** (a Curve-esque *Emergency DAO*) will have the right to disable hostile gauges.

The **Emergency Council** will initially consist of Kodo team members and members from within the Taiko community.

## Permissionless Listing Soonâ„¢

A permissionless *whitelisting* on-chain governance process will be implemented in the future, pending required on-chain governance infrastructure on Taiko.
